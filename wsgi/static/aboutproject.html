<h3>So what's this about anyway</h3>
<strong>How To Use</strong>
<br>
<p>This is a project that will enable you to find out what to look for when you are out on a date and you need to impress your "friend."  We mean, it's a twitter account that tells you astronomical events in your neighbourhood.  If you want to request info about planetary events or satellites tweet @astro_tweet_bot in the form:</p>
<p>@astro_tweet_bot, sky, [start time]+[length time], ([number 1-6], [list of events])</p>
<p>@astro_tweet_bot, satellite, [postal code]</p>
<p>We should get back to you in about a minute :)</p>
